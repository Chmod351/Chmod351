## About me 
👋 Hello, my name is Yamil Tauil, and I am a backend developer with less than one year of experience. Although I am new to the field, I am eager to learn and improve my skills every day. I am passionate about developing applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly.

I am well-versed in Git, Scrum, Kanban, Agile, Git flow, JavaScript, and Linux. Additionally, I am familiar with various databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and I have experience working with Node.js and Express frameworks. I am proficient in testing frameworks such as Jest and Swagger, and I have experience with API Rests and Docker.

I am continuously seeking to improve my knowledge and skills and have recently been learning about implementing design patterns. As a team player, I enjoy working with others, and I believe that collaboration is key to achieving success in any project.

Overall, I am excited to continue growing as a developer and to contribute my skills to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on people's lives.
